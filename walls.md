After publishing our movie “The Birth Of A Wooden House” many people asked to share our recipe of the natural plaster we have made and used on the walls. So here is the recipe.

Pail of 20 litres

Clay Powder 1 Pail (20 litres)
Quartz sand (super smooth finish) or Sifted gravel (more rustic finish) 2 1/2 Pails (50 litres)
Chalk powder 1/3 Pail (6.5 litres)
Hydrated lime 1/3 Pail (6.5 litres)
Linen fibres or cattail wool (chopped smooth) - 1/3 Pail 
Wheat paste - 1/2 Pail (10 litres) 
Salt (must be added to the wheat paste while boiling) 1 kilo
Water 1 Pail (20 litres)

Salt is being added because to avoid fungus in the wheat paste while the plaster dries.

- First add the water to the container where you will be mixing the plaster.
- Then add clay powder, lime and linen fibre. Linen fibres works as internal structural fixture of the plaster).
- Mix all together. Add the sand, then mix.
- Add wheat paste, mix all together. The plaster should not be to thick, otherwise it will be hard to work with. It should be quite fluid.
- Apply with a Japanese towel.
- Smooth out few hours later with cellulose sponge, leave to dry.

> If you want you can leave the natural colour of the plaster (coffee with milk colour) or paint with nature lime & marble breathable paint.
> Best one is Italian SIKKENS CHALIX DECOR FINITURA.
> It can be used also as finish plaster, but mixed with water it can be used as paint/lime wash.
> Always apply clay plaster on the steel set, instead of plastic, otherwise you might have cracks.
> Can be applied on any surface - stone wall, wooden wall, straw bale wall, plasterboard, brick wall.
> The best is to apply on the wood fibre panels.
> Always apply 2 layers of plaster.
> Before the 2nd layer moist up the walls.

The 2nd layer do not need linen fibre or cattail wool to be added to the plaster as it should have to be applied in very thin layer and will work only as smooth finish.
